            <p id="id1" >
                From the 1950s to present day 2020, skateboarding has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry impacting millions of lives across the world as an artform and a sport. In its history, skateboarding has inaugurated its own museums, awarded its own hall of fame and curated a self-documented history cementing a special place in the heart of freedom culture.
                The launch ramp of 1950’s California lit the torch of skateboarding to be handed off to each new generation over the coming eras. In these decades, skateboarding transcended through ups and downs of economic prosperity and mainstream popularity as different faces and figures shined in the spotlight or dominated the back alleys of urban performance.
                Between the youth of the world and those aging skateboarders who’ve watched it grow and change, the question of "What is skateboarding?" has undergone a metamorphosis with each passing of the baton. While we do our best to answer this question again here, we take our first push into a larger world. A world defined by the ultimate expression of freedom, movement, and an intimate look at the history of skateboarding.It’s difficult to imagine ourselves in the 1950s or 1970s DogTown eras–the birthplace of skateboarding. It would be even more difficult to imagine how much skateboarding would change since its conception. In the early 1960s, skateboard companies like Hobie and Makaha began advertising skating as “sidewalk surfing,” or an alternative to surfing when the waves were flat. By 1963, Makaha formed the first professional skateboarding team competing in the first ever skateboard competition later that year in Hermosa, California. While the remnants of early 1960s downhill skateboarding competitions take the form of death defying 2020 San Francisco hill-bombs, the freestyle competition formats and most tricks performed at the Hermosa competition are now but a distant memory to contemporary skateboarding.
                Even with its novelty in American sports, skateboarding popularity ultimately crashed by 1965. People were more likely to go to a roller derby competition than a skateboarding competition. Skateboarding in the media began advertising skating as a dangerous activity, while the clay wheels and handstands grew as tiresome as watching a hula-hooper for hours on end. To understand how skateboarding nearly perished is to understand ultimately why its earliest forms are no longer seen. But more importantly, comparing where skateboarding is today from these times, we see one of the greatest transformations of a sport and performance art in the 20th to 21st century.
                As skateboarding evolved in a post-Tony Hawk era, skateboarding’s interaction with society changed. Skateboarding deepened its roots in street skateboarding, as the definition of being a professional skateboarder shifted from competition skating to video parts while mainstream skate culture saw itself in novel forms of entertainment. The Tony Hawk Pro Skater video games franchise ensured Tony Hawk and "the ollie" were a household name. Bam Margera would go on to parody a pro-skateboarder career with a reality television show, “Viva-La-Bam.” As companies entered the fold, skateboarding gained more recognition and skating’s elite began making palpable salaries.
                Today, Street League and the X-Games draw the largest crowds in years. With more eyes comes more scrutiny, as today a juvenile distaste and adolescence is still associated with skateboarding in dominant forms of media. That being said, the off-shoots of skateboarding have also grown tremendously to tip the scales back into the hands of skateboarders. In the past five to ten years, female skateboarders are the sport’s largest growing demographic, with skateboarding now the largest female sport in Afghanistan. Skateparks are now found on every major continent of the World with countless clips filmed and posted to social media everyday. Skateboarding endures as one of the world’s most inclusive and accessible expressions of freedom.
                Skateboarding remains in a constant state of evolution. With each skateboarder not only defining their own relationship with their skateboard but what skateboarding means to them. With each contribution to skating it continues to be molded by those who need it most. Sometimes this means combating outside forces, sometimes this means inviting them in. Either way, the history of skateboarding is still being written and ultimately, thanks to the skateboarders who came before us, skating will forever be defined by those who truly love skateboarding, and no one else.
